# Yeah Buddeh - Gym App
A full-stack gym app, not unlike muscle-wiki. This app allows you to search and explore fitness exercises and learn them via a detailed animated diagram.
## Features

- A simple but intuitive homepage with recommended exercises
- Categorised and searchable exercises 
- Exercises are pulled from an API and displayed on a webpage, a detailed and animated diagram shows the user how to do the exercise
- Relevant tutorial videos are also available from the exercise page for a better explanation on how to do the exercise
- Beneath the exercise, suggested exercises can be found for the similar muscle group or used equipment

## Current issues to fix
- I need to fix an issue where the app doesn't automatically scroll back to the top whenever an exercise is selected
- I need to optimise the UI to make it look better
